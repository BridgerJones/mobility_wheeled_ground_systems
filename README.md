# Mobility for Wheeled Ground Systems Simulations

# Dependencies
This requires python3, matplotlib, numpy, and turtle.

# Usage
`python3 main.py`
This will generate pyplots of each problem in order. When you close one, it will
load the next.

You can generate a path and then call bot.turtlefy() to see an animated version.
This has to run as a separate python process so you have to run each path one at
a time.
